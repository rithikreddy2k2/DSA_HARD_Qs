## Intuition Behind Maximal Rectangle in a Binary Matrix ##
The problem is about finding the largest rectangular area that consists of only 1's in a binary matrix. To solve this efficiently, we can leverage the concept of transforming each row of the matrix into a histogram and then using the "Largest Rectangle in Histogram" technique.

Let's break down the intuition step by step:

## Step 1: Understanding Each Row as a Histogram ## 
Each row of the matrix is treated as a base for building a histogram.

The value at each cell in the matrix (matrix[i][j]) indicates whether that column will contribute to a bar in the histogram or reset the height of the bar.

If matrix[i][j] == '1', then we extend the height of the histogram bar at column j by 1.
If matrix[i][j] == '0', then the height at column j is reset to 0.

## Example Matrix: ## 
matrix = [  ['1', '0', '1', '0', '0'],
  ['1', '0', '1', '1', '1'],
  ['1', '1', '1', '1', '1'],
  ['1', '0', '0', '1', '0']
]
We can visualize the process of transforming each row into a histogram by maintaining a heights array that stores the consecutive 1's up to the current row.

## Step 2: Building the Heights Array ##
For every row, we calculate the heights array:

heights[j] holds the number of consecutive '1's seen in column j from row 0 to the current row.
Let's walk through the example matrix:

Row 0 (['1', '0', '1', '0', '0']):

Heights array: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
This directly corresponds to the number of consecutive '1's in each column for this row.
Row 1 (['1', '0', '1', '1', '1']):

Heights array: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]
The value of heights[j] increases by 1 if matrix[i][j] is '1', otherwise it's reset to 0.
Row 2 (['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']):

Heights array: [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]
The histogram now has varying heights as we accumulate the number of consecutive 1's across columns.
Row 3 (['1', '0', '0', '1', '0']):

Heights array: [4, 0, 0, 3, 0]
Any 0's in the matrix reset the corresponding height values in the histogram.

## Step 3: Largest Rectangle in Histogram Approach ## 
Now, for each row's heights array, the problem boils down to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram.

The height of each histogram bar represents the height of the rectangle, and the width is determined by how far we can expand left and right while maintaining at least the same height.

To solve this efficiently, we use a stack-based approach. The idea is to traverse the heights array, and for each height, we compute the maximal rectangle that can be formed using that height as the smallest bar in the rectangle.

## Step 4: Stack-Based Approach for Largest Rectangle ## 
Why the Stack?

The stack helps us keep track of the indices of histogram bars. As we traverse the heights array, we ensure that the bars in the stack are in increasing order.
When we encounter a bar that is smaller than the bar at the top of the stack, it means we can no longer extend the rectangle for the bar at the top. So, we pop it and calculate the area of the rectangle formed by that bar.
Calculating Width:

The width of the rectangle is calculated by the difference between the current index and the index of the bar just below the popped one in the stack (i.e., the last bar that was smaller than the current one).
Final Pass:
After traversing the entire heights array, we pop any remaining bars from the stack and compute the area for the rectangles they form.

## Step 5: Putting It All Together ## 
For each row in the matrix:

We update the heights array.
We compute the largest rectangle in the histogram formed by that row's heights array.
We track the maximum rectangle area encountered across all rows.

## Example Walkthrough ##
Using the example matrix, letâ€™s walk through the algorithm:

First row (['1', '0', '1', '0', '0']):

Heights: [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Maximum rectangle area: 1 (single bar with height 1).
Second row (['1', '0', '1', '1', '1']):

Heights: [2, 0, 2, 1, 1]
Maximum rectangle area: 3 (formed by the three consecutive bars of height 1 in the last three columns).
Third row (['1', '1', '1', '1', '1']):

Heights: [3, 1, 3, 2, 2]
Maximum rectangle area: 6 (formed by the two bars of height 3 and width 2 in the first and third columns).
Fourth row (['1', '0', '0', '1', '0']):

Heights: [4, 0, 0, 3, 0]
Maximum rectangle area remains 6.
The final answer is the maximum rectangle area found, which is 6.
